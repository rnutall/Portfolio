        Hey! How's it going today? Thank you for checking out my Portfolio; it
        contains all the projects I've worked on and been fortunate to work on
        with others. Skills that I've learned, in my journey of coding Full
        Stack have helped me understand the nuance, and concepts of all the new
        Tech out today. I have spent a lot of time learning these concepts and
        getting a chance to perfect them with a group of brilliant individuals.
        It would be an exciting experience to learn from a world class team of
        developers, Willing to mentor an entrepreneur who is a novice at web
        dev. but no stranger to customer service, hard work, late nights, early
        morning deadlines, business, building from the ground up, and using the
        necessary tools in us to get the job done. Please enjoy my Portfolio
        this is an exciting journey for me; as a Master Barber/ entrepreneur of
        20yrs; too learning Web Development and advanced concepts. For me, as an
        entrepreneur and life learner; to be able to include these in my resume
        of learned things, is amazing. Thank you again for your time in looking
        over my Portfolio. If one should have any Questions, Please feel free
        too shoot me an email. Thanks again for checking out my work. I looK
        forward to working with you.
