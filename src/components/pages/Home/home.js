        Hey hows it going today? Thank you for checking out my Portfolio. it
        contains all the projects I've been working on. and the skills that I've
        learned in my journey of coding Full Stack. I have spent a lot of time
        learning these concepts and getting a chance to perfect them with a group 
        of brilliant individuals would be an exciting experience Id enjoy learning from.
        So please enjoy my Portfolio and if you have any questions feel free too shoot
         me an email.


         Thanks again for checking out my work.
         Rodney Nutall
